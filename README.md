# PIG
dont use this

File storage
```
test.pigg
- VARSTORSTRING.Vpigg
- VARSTORINT.Vpigg
- VARSTORINP.Vpigg
```

# TODO 

- out of syntax errors
- Inclusion method
- Integer Stuf
- User Input (private readings, not needed until if statements are implemented)

Currently working on:
> Inclusion method (maybe), Integer Stuf

# var mangangment system

We have two types of variables, strings and integers.

## Integers
Can have two states

- public, prints to the terminal autmaticaly
- private, stores a variable in the memory

### Private Integer (extra)

- be able to add on a value
- be able to erase it from the memory

# What is it for?
I am making pig as experience for programming as the only other "big" project that I made
was a password maker / manager that I made over a year ago. Since then I have expanded my
reach and I want to test that.

# Files how to?
To create a pig file do the following:

- Make a new folder (the name doesn't matter)
- And in the folder make a file with the file extension .pigg
- In the following file, I will show you some basic syntax to put in
```
println("Hello")

// This is a comment (omg)

new string name = Sean
call string name

new integer public age = 12
call integer age

new input lol
call input public lol

new input priv
call input private priv

add 10, 10
subtract 25, 5
divide 10, 2
multi 5, 2

STOP
```
- Then copy pig.py from src in pig
- paste it into your folder with the .pigg file in it
- run the pig.py file
- it will open a window and close it
- but it will also create a new .bat file called build
- this is what you open now to compile your file

<NOTE> NOTE: open up the pig.py file and in it change the FILE variable to the name of your file </NOTE>

# Things that need to be implemented:
- if statements
- other things
- comments
- while loops
- (maybe) for loops
